    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Add these Parmesan cheese crisps to your charcuterie board, garnish a soup, or use in a salad instead of croutons. 
            I like to use store-bought shredded Parmesan, as it gives the crisps a "lacy" appearance. 
            You can also use freshly-shredded Parmesan, which will melt more easily, and the crisps will have a smoother, filled-in appearance. 
            You can add a light sprinkle of your favorite seasoning to each crisp before baking, for added flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup shredded Paremesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Using a tablespoon, create 16 mounds of cheese, about 2 inches in diameter, spaced at least 1 inch apart, on the prepared baking sheet. Press down on the middle of each mound to make them evenly thick.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is completely melted and edges are browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the oven to cool for 15 minutes. Remove from baking sheet and store at room temperature in an air-tight container for up to 5 days.</li>
                <br>
            </ol>
